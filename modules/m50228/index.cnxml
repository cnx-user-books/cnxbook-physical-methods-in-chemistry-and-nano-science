It was this work that provided the foundation for the development of gas chromatography. In fact, Martin envisioned gas chromatography almost ten years before, while working with R. L. M. Synge (<link target-id="import-auto-id1165397151299"/>) on partition chromatography. Martin and Synge, who were awarded the chemistry Nobel prize in 1941, suggested that separation of volatile compounds could be achieved by using a vapor as the mobile phase instead of a liquid.</para><figure id="import-auto-id1165399246431"><media id="import-auto-id1165409824110" alt="">

Nowadays, gas chromatography is a mature technique, widely used worldwide for the analysis of almost every type of organic compound, even those that are not volatile in their original state but can be converted to volatile derivatives.</para>

      <para id="import-auto-id1165399970699">During a GC separation, the sample is vaporized and carried by the mobile gas phase (i.e., the carrier gas) through the column. Separation of the different components is achieved based on their relative vapor pressure and affinities for the stationary phase. The affinity of a substance towards the stationary phase can be described in chemical terms as an equilibrium constant called the distribution constant K<sub>c</sub>, also known as the partition coefficient, <link target-id="eip-232"/>, where [A]<sub>s</sub> is the concentration of compound A in the stationary phase and [A]<sub>m</sub> is the concentration of compound A in the stationary phase. </para><equation id="eip-232"><media id="import-auto-id1165400263220X" alt="">

<para id="import-auto-id1165398405773">The role of the carrier gas -GC mobile phase- is to carry the sample molecules along the column while they are not dissolved in or adsorbed on the stationary phase.  The carrier gas is inert and does not interact with the sample, and thus  GC separation's selectivity can be attributed to the stationary phase alone. However, the choice of carrier gas is important to maintain high efficiency. The effect of different carrier gases on column efficiency is represented by the van Deemter (packed columns) and the Golay equation (capillary columns). The van Deemter equation, <link target-id="eip-396"/>, describes the three  main effects  that contribute to band broadening in packed columns and, as a consequence, to a reduced efficiency in the separation process.</para><equation id="eip-396"><media id="import-auto-id1165400263220" alt="">

To define a capillary column, four parameters must be specified:</para>
          <list id="import-auto-id1165398549838" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic"><item>The stationary phase is the parameter that will determine the final resolution obtained, and will influence other selection parameters. Changing the stationary phase is the most powerful way to alter selectivity in GC analysis.</item>
            <item>The length is related to the overall efficiency of the column and to overall analysis time. A longer column will increase the peak efficiency and the quality of the separation, but it will also increase analysis time. One of the classical trade-offs in gas chromatography (GC) separations lies between speed of analysis and peak resolution.</item>
            <item>The column internal diameter (ID) can influence column efficiency (and therefore resolution) and also column capacity. By decreasing the column internal diameter, better separations can be achieved, but column overload and peak broadening may become an issue.</item>
            <item>The sample capacity of the column will also depend on film thickness. Moreover, the retention of sample components will be affected by the thickness of the film, and therefore its retention time. A shorter run time and higher resolution can be achieved using thin films, however these films offer lower capacity.</item>

          <title>Detector </title>
          <para id="import-auto-id1165399819063">The detector senses a physicochemical property of the analyte and provides a response which is amplified and converted into an electronic signal to produce a chromatogram. Most of the detectors used in GC were invented specifically for this technique, except for the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and the mass spectrometer. In total, approximately 60 detectors have been used in GC. Detectors that exhibit an enhanced response to certain analyte types are known as "selective detectors". </para><para id="import-auto-id1165399216307">During the last 10 years there had been an increasing use of GC in combination with mass spectrometry (MS). The mass spectrometer has become a standard detector that allows for lower detection limits and does not require the separation of all components present in the sample. Mass spectroscopy is one of the types of detection that provides the most information with only micrograms of sample. Qualitative identification of unknown compounds as well as quantitative analysis of samples is possible using GC-MS. When GC is coupled to a mass spectrometer, the compounds that elute from the GC column are ionized by using electrons (EI, electron ionization) or a chemical reagent (CI, chemical ionization). Charged fragments are focused and accelerated into a mass analyzer: typically a quadrupole mass analyzer. Fragments with different mass to charge ratios will generate different signals, so any compound that produces ions within the mass range of the mass analyzer will be detected.  Detection limits of 1-10 ng or even lower values (e.g., 10 pg) can be achieved selecting the appropriate scanning mode. </para></section>
