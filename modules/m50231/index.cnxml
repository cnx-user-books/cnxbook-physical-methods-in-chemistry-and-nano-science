      <para id="import-auto-id3414900">Ion Chromatography is a method of separating ions based on their distinct retention rates in a given solid phase packing material.  Given different retention rates for two anions or two cations, the elution time of each ion will differ, allowing for detection and separation of one ion before the other.  Detection methods are separated between electrochemical methods and spectroscopic methods.  This guide will cover the principles of retention rates for anions and cations, as well as describing the various types of solid-state packing materials and eluents that can be used.  </para>
