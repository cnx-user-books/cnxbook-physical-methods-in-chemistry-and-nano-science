  <md:title>The Application of Fluorescence Spectroscopy in the Mercury Ion Detection</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Mercury ion, one of the most toxic metal ions, is wildly distributed in the environment. It can accumulate in human bodies and endanger human health. Therefore, to detect mercury ion becomes important and necessary.
      Fluorescence chemosensor is becoming more and more popular due to its easy use, low cost and high efficiency. In this paper, relevant knowledge about fluorescence spectroscopy and chemosensor will be introduced, and examples of its application in the detection of mercury ion will also be covered.</md:abstract>

      <title>Mercury in the environment </title>
      <para id="id1167587114877">Mercury pollution has become a global problem and seriously endangers human health. Inorganic mercury can be easily released into the environment through a variety of anthropogenic sources, such as the coal mining, solid waste incineration, fossil fuel combustion, and chemical manufacturing. It can also be released through the nonanthropogenic sources in the form of forest fires, volcanic emissions, and oceanic emission.</para>
      <para id="id1167587195888">Mercury can be easily transported into the atmosphere as the form of the mercury vapor. The atmospheric deposition of mercury ions leads to the accumulation on plants, in topsoil, in water, and in underwater sediments. Some prokaryotes living in the sediments can convert the inorganic mercury into methylmercury, which can enter food chain and finally is ingested by human.</para>
      <para id="id1167587392059">Mercury seriously endangers peopleâ€™s health. One example is that many people died due to exposure to methylmercury through seafood consumption in Minamata, Japan. Exposure in the organic mercury causes a serious of neurological problems, such as prenatal brain damage, cognitive and motion disorders, vision and hearing loss, and even death. Moreover, inorganic mercury also targets the renal epithelial cells of the kidney, which results in tubular necrosis and proteinuria.</para>
      <para id="id1167595353535">The crisis of mercury in the environment and biological system compel people to carry out related work to confront the challenge. To design and implement new mercury detection tools will ultimately aid these endeavors. Therefore, in this paper, we will mainly introduce fluorescence molecular sensor, which is becoming more and more important in mercury detection due to its easy use, low cost and high efficiency.</para>

        <para id="id1167596178944">In the PET sensors, photoinduced electron transfer makes the transfer of recognition information to fluorescence signal between receptor and fluorophore come true. <link target-id="id1167599716538"/> shows the detailed process of how PET works in the fluorescence molecular sensor. The receptor could provide the electron to the vacated electoral orbital of the excited fluorophore. The excited electron in the fluorophore could not come back the original orbital, resulting in the quenching of fluorescence emission. The coordination of receptor and guest decreased the electron donor ability of receptor reduced or even disrupted the PET process, then leading to the enhancement of intensity of fluorescence emission. Therefore, the sensors had weak or no fluorescence emission before the coordination. However, the intensity of fluorescence emission would increase rapidly after the coordination of receptor and gust.</para>

        <title>Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)</title>
        <para id="id1167589016486">Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) is also named photoinduced charge transfer. The characteristic structure of ICT sensors includes only the fluorophore and recognition group, but no spacer. The recognition group directly binds to the fluorophore. The electron withdrawing or electron donating substituents on the recognition group plays an important role in the recognition. When the recognition happens, the coordination between the recognition group and guest affects the electron density in the fluorophore, resulting in the change of fluorescence emission in the form of blue shift or red shift. </para>

        <title>Excimer </title>
        <para id="id1167587443088">When the two fluorophores are in the proper distance, an intermolecular excimer can be formed between the excited state and ground state. The fluorescence emission of the excimer is different with the monomer and mainly in the form of new, broad, strong, and long wavelength emission without fine structures. The proper distance determines the formation of excimer, therefore modulation of the distance between the two fluorophores becomes crucial in the design of the sensors based on this mechanism. The fluorophores have long lifetime in the singlet state to be easily forming the excimers. They are often used in such sensors.</para>

In one system, there are two different fluorophores, in which one acts as a donor of excited state energy to the receptor of the other. As shown in <link target-id=" id1167596182300 "/>, the receptor accepts the energy from the excited state of the donor and gives the fluorescence emission, while the donor will return back to the electronic ground state.  There are three factors affecting the performance of FRET. They are the distance between the donor and the acceptor, the proper orientation between the donor emission dipole moment and acceptor absorption moment, and the extent of spectral overlap between the donor emission and acceptor absorption spectrum (<link target-id=" id1167587506024"/>). </para>
