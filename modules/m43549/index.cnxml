STM was invented by Gerd Binnig (<link target-id="import-auto-id1163676833772"/>)  and Heinrich Rohrer (<link target-id="import-auto-id1163668012321"/>), who both won the 1986 Nobel Prize in physics for their technological advances. </para><figure id="import-auto-id1163676833772"><media id="import-auto-id1163671578925" alt="">

The tip is brought within a fraction of a nanometer of an electrically conducting sample. At close distances, the electron clouds of the metal tip overlap with the electron clouds of the surface atoms (<link target-id="import-auto-id1163677314507"/> inset). If a small voltage is applied between the tip and the sample a tunneling current is generated. The magnitude of this  tunneling current is dependent on the bias voltage applied and the distance between the tip and the surface. A current amplifier can covert the generated tunneling current into a voltage. The magnitude of the resulting voltage as compared to the initial voltage can then be used to control the piezodrive, which controls the distance between the tip and the surface (i.e., the <emphasis effect="italics">z</emphasis> direction).  By scanning the tip in the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis> directions, the tunneling current can be measured across the entire sample. The STM system can operate in either of two modes: . </para><list id="eip-475" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic"><item>Constant height. </item>

This method is dangerous for use in samples with fluctuations in height as the fixed tip might contact and destroy raised areas of the sample.  A common method for non-uniformly smooth samples is constant current mode. In this mode, a target current value, called the set point, is selected and the tunneling current data gathered from the sample is compared to the target value. If the collected voltage deviates from the set point, the tip is moved in the <emphasis effect="italics">z</emphasis>  direction and the voltage is measured again until the target voltage is reached. The change in the <emphasis effect="italics">z</emphasis>  direction required to reach the set point is recorded across the entire sample and plotted as a representation of the topography of the sample. The height data is typically displayed as a gray scale image of the topography of the sample, where lighter areas typically indicate raised sample areas and darker spots indicate protrusions. These images are typically colored for better contrast. </para><para id="import-auto-id1163673565511">The standard method of STM, described above, is useful for many substances (including high precision optical components, disk drive surfaces, and buckyballs) and is typically used under ultrahigh vacuum to avoid contamination of the samples from the surrounding systems.

      <title>Spin-polarized STM</title><para id="import-auto-id1163677364954">Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) can be used to provide detailed information of magnetic phenomena on the single-atom scale. This imaging technique is particularly important for accurate measurement of superconductivity and high-density magnetic data storage devices. In addition, SP-STM, while sensitive to the partial magnetic moments of the sample, is not a field-sensitive technique and so can be applied in a variety of different magnetic fields. </para><section id="import-auto-id1163675570408">
        <title>Device setup and sample preparation</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1163662158191">In SP-STM, the STM tip is coated with a thin layer of magnetic material. As with STM, voltage is then applied between tip and sample resulting in tunneling current. Atoms with partial magnetic moments that are aligned in the same direction as the partial magnetic moment of the atom at the very tip of the STM tip show a higher magnitude of tunneling current due to the interactions between the magnetic moments. Likewise, atoms with partial magnetic moments opposite that of the atom at the tip of the STM tip demonstrate a reduced tunneling current (<link target-id="import-auto-id1163671175150"/>). A computer program can then translate the change in tunneling current to a topographical map, showing the spin density on the surface of the sample.</para><figure id="import-auto-id1163671175150"><media id="import-auto-id1163668026175" alt="">

        <caption>Schematic illustration of magnetized tip for SP-STM.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1163676874105">The sensitivity to magnetic moments depends greatly upon the direction of the magnetic moment of the tip, which can be controlled by the magnetic properties of the material used to coat the outermost layer of the tungsten STM probe.  A wide variety of magnetic materials have been studied as possible coatings, including both ferromagnetic materials, such as a thin coat of iron or of gadolinium, and antiferromagnetic materials such as chromium. Another method that has been used to make a magnetically sensitive probe tip is irradiation of a semiconducting GaAs tip with high energy circularly polarized light. This irradiation causes a splitting of electrons in the GaAs valence band and population of the conduction band with spin-polarized electrons. These spin-polarized electrons then provide partial magnetic moments which in turn influence the tunneling current generated by the sample surface.  </para><para id="import-auto-id1163676743236">Sample preparation for SP-STM is essentially the same as for STM. SP-STM has been used to image samples such as thin films and nanoparticle constructs as well as determining the magnetic topography of thin metallic sheets such as in <link target-id="import-auto-id1163661120038"/>.  The upper image is a traditional STM image of a thin layer of cobalt, which shows the topography of the sample. The second image is an SP-STM image of the same layer of cobalt, which shows the magnetic domain of the sample. The two images, when combined provide useful information about the exact location of the partial magnetic moments within the sample. </para><figure id="import-auto-id1163661120038"><media id="import-auto-id1163667819608" alt="">

        <title>Limitations</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1163671129553">One of the major limitations with SP-STM is that both distance and partial magnetic moment yield the same contrast in a SP-STM image. This can be corrected by combination with conventional STM to get multi-domain structures and/or topological information which can then be overlaid on top of the SP-STM image, correcting for differences in sample height as opposed to magnetization. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1163674167362">The properties of the magnetic tip dictate much of the properties of the technique itself. If the outermost atom of the tip is not properly magnetized, the technique will yield no more information than a traditional STM. The direction of the magnetization vector of the tip is also of great importance. If the magnetization vector of the tip is perpendicular to the magnetization vector of the sample, there will be no spin contrast. It is therefore important to carefully choose the coating applied to the tungsten STM tip in order to align appropriately with the expected magnetic moments of the sample. Also, the coating makes the magnetic tips more expensive to produce than standard STM tips. In addition, these tips are often made of mechanically soft materials, causing them to wear quickly and require a high cost of maintenance. </para></section>

      <title>Ballistic electron emission microscopy</title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1163677313261">Ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM) is a technique commonly used to image semiconductor interfaces. Conventional surface probe techniques can provide detailed information on the formation of interfaces, but lack the ability to study fully formed interfaces due to inaccessibility to the surface. BEEM allows for the ability to obtain a quantitative measure of electron transport across fully formed interfaces, something necessary for many industrial applications.</para>

        <title>Device setup and sample preparation</title><para id="import-auto-id1163661154989">BEEM utilizes STM with a three-electrode configuration, as seen in <link target-id="import-auto-id1163677314507"/>. In this technique, ballistic electrons are first injected from a STM tip into the sample, traditionally composed of at least two layers separated by an interface, which rests on three indium contact pads that provide a connection to a base electrode (<link target-id="import-auto-id1163674568994"/>). As the voltage is applied to the sample, electrons tunnel across the vacuum and through the first layer of the sample, reaching the interface, and then scatter. Depending on the magnitude of the voltage, some percentage of the electrons tunnel through the interface, and can be collected and measured as a current at a collector attached to the other side of the sample. The voltage from the STM tip is then varied, allowing for measurement of the barrier height. The barrier height is defined as the threshold at which electrons will cross the interface and are measurable as a current in the far collector. At a metal/n-type semiconductor interface this is the difference between the conduction band minimum and the Fermi level. At a metal/p-type semiconductor interface this is the difference between the valence band maximum of the semiconductor and the metal Fermi level. If the voltage is less than the barrier height, no electrons will cross the interface and the collector will read zero. If the voltage is greater than the barrier height, useful information can be gathered about the magnitude of the current at the collector as opposed to the initial voltage.</para><figure id="import-auto-id1163674568994"><media id="import-auto-id1163677698222" alt="">

This field is characteristic of the sample material on the TIR surface, and can be measured by a sharpened optical fiber probe tip where the light intensity is converted to an electrical signal (<link target-id="import-auto-id1163672221743"/>).
