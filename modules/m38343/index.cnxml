  <md:title>The Analysis of Liquid Crystal Phases using Polarized Optical Microscopy</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Liquid crystals (LCs) have tremendous applications in industry fields such as LCs display, LCs thermometer and polymers. In this paper, different types of LCs with its unique property will be introduced. The theory of birefringence and working mechanism of polarized optical microscope (POM) are demonstrated. We also illustrate the methods for analyzing LCs by using polarized optical microscope.</md:abstract>

There are basically three different types of liquid crystal phases:  </para>

<list id="eip-243">

<item>Thermotropic liquid crystal phases are dependent on temperature.</item>

<item>Lyotropic liquid crystal phases are dependent on temperature and the concentration of LCs in the solvent. </item>

<item>Metallotropic LCs are composed of organic and inorganic molecules, and the phase transition not only depend on temperature and concentration, but also depend on the ratio between organic and inorganic molecules. </item>
</list>



<para id="eip-53">Thermotropic LCs are the most widely used one, which can be divided into five categories: </para>

<list id="eip-227"><item>Nematic phase in which rod-shaped molecules have no positional order, but they self-align to have long-range directional order with their long axes roughly parallel (<link target-id="idLC11"/>a). </item>

<item>Smactic phase where the molecules are positionally ordered along one direction in well-defined layers oriented either along the layer normal (smectic A) or tilted away from the layer normal (smectic C), see <link target-id="idLC11"/>b).</item>

<item>Chiral phase which exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director (<link target-id="idLC11"/>c).</item>

<item>Blue phase having a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of light (<link target-id="idLC31"/>). </item>

<item>Discotic phase in which disk-shaped LC molecules can orient themselves in a layer-like fashion (<link target-id="idLC21"/>). </item>

</list>

<para id="eip-698">Thermotropic LCs are very sensitive to temperature. If the temperature is too high, thermal motion will destroy the ordering of LCs, and push it into a liquid phase. If the temperature is too low, thermal motion is hard to perform, so the material will become crystal phase.</para>

<para id="eip-867">The existence of liquid crystal phase can be detected by using polarized optical microscopy, since liquid crystal phase exhibits its unique texture under microscopy. The contrasting areas in the texture correspond to domains where LCs are oriented towards different directions.</para>

      <section id="id1171467675980"><title>Polarized optical microscopy</title><para id="id1171461408219">Polarized optical microscopy is typically used to detect the existence of liquid crystal phases in a solution.<sup/>The principle of this is corresponding to the polarization of light. A polarizer is a filter that only permits the light oriented in a specific direction with its polarizing direction to pass through. There are two polarizers in a polarizing optical microscope (POM) (<link target-id="id1171461334485"/>) and they are designed to be oriented at right angle to each other, which is termed as cross polar. The fundamental of cross polar is illustrated in <link target-id="id1171465889094"/>, the polarizing direction of the first polarizer is oriented vertically to the incident beam, so only the waves with vertical direction can pass through it. The passed wave is subsequently blocked by the second polarizer, since this polarizer is oriented horizontally to the incident wave. </para>

      <section id="id1171443627474"><title>Theory of birefringence</title><para id="id1171442630563">Birefringent or doubly-refracting sample has a unique property that it can produce two individual wave components while one wave passes through it, those two components are termed as ordinary and extraordinary waves. <link target-id="id1171448918540"/> is an illustration of a typical construction of Nicol polarizing prism, as we can see, the non-plarized white light are splitted into two ray as it passes through the prism. The one travels out of the prism is called ordinary ray, and the other one is called extraordinary ray. So if we have a birefringent specimen located between the polarizer and analyzer, the initial light will be separated into two waves when it passes though the specimen. After exiting the specimen, the light components become out of phase, but are recombined with constructive and destructive interference when they pass through the analyzer. Now the combined wave will have elliptically or circularly polarized light wave, see <link target-id="id1171448918540"/>, image contrast arises from the interaction of plane-polarized light with a birefringent specimen so some amount of wave will pass through the analyzer and give a bright domain on the specimen. </para>

There are two crossed polarizers in this system, and liquid crystal (cholesteric spiral pattern) sandwich with positive and negative charging is located between these two polarizers. When the liquid crystal is charged, waves can pass through without changing orientations. When the liquid crystal is out of charge, waves will be rotated 90Â° as it passes through LCs so it can pass through the second polarizer. There are seven separately charged electrodes in the LCD, so the LCD can exhibit different numbers from 0 to 9 by adjusting the electrodes. For example, when the upper right and lower left electrodes are charged, we can get 2 on the display.</para>

The optical sign includes positive and negative. If the ordinary wavefront is faster than the extraordinary wavefront (see <link target-id=" id1171448918540 "/>), the specimen displays positive birefringence. Conversly, a negative birefringence will be detected if the ordinary wavefront is slower than the extraordinary wavefront. In addition, the retardation plate is also useful for enhancing contrast in weakly birefringent specimens. <link target-id="id1171463627558"/> shows the effect of first order retardation plate on the contrast of birefringence. The birefringence is so weak that the morphology on the edge of the tissue is hard to image, <link target-id="id1171463627558"/>a.
